18, we were undergrads 
Stayed out late, never made it to class, uh 
Outer Richmond in a taxi cab 
You were sweating bullets on the way to my dad’s 
And oh, 
You said, “Baby, think we’re moving too fast!” 
 
And I swear the magnolias flashed a smile (flashed a smile) 
And that’s when I caught me hoping you’d stay a while (stay a whiiiile) 
 
Baby, I’d give up anything to travel inside your mind 
Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime 
My daddy taught me to choose ‘em wisely but you don’t have to try 
Coz baby I fall in love every summertime 
  
25, man we’re missing church 
Laugh ‘bout everyone we’re hating at work 
Dinner with your sister and the jokes kinda hurt  
Cry the way home and you’re putting me first, oh 
Yeah, you just always know what to say 
 
We’re strolling down the boulevard, and dancing under streetlights (oh the lights) 
Every year we get older and I’m still on your side (oh IIIII) 
 
Baby, I’d give up anything to travel inside your mind 
Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime 
My daddy taught me to choose ‘em wisely but you don’t have to try 
Coz baby I fall in love every summertime 
 
Every day is summertime 
Every day is summertime 
Every day is summertime  
with you
